# Mini-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-NIDS-
This project implements a **mini Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**, designed to detect suspicious activities such as port scanning and network intrusions by analyzing network traffic. The NIDS is built using **Python** and leverages the **Scapy** library for packet inspection.
